# CircuitPython 

	
	# Hello CircuitPython 

This was my first circuitpython assignment, It was pretty simple, all I had to do was copy some code given to me from canvas.
In this assignment I learned some of the very basics of CircuitPython. 


	#CircuitPython Servo 

In this assignemnt I had to make a servo move in either direction when a wire was touched. This was something that I had not done before so I had to use google to try and help me, but with some time I figured out how to complete it.
In this assignment I learned how to use the "Capacitive Touch"

	#CircuitPython LCD 

During this assignment I had to wire up an lcd screen and make it have a counter that told you how many times you pressed it in the up direction, also it had another button that switched it so that when you clicked the other button it made the number go down instead of up. 
This assignment gave me some trouble for multiple reasons, one my buttons were very inconsistent in the fact that it only recognized that I was clicking the button about 50% of the time. Also I didn't know what strings were and I learned how to use them to make this assignment work. 


	#CircuitPython Photointerrupters 

For this assignment I had to use a photointerrupter to detect how many times something interrupted it every 4 seconds. This was not all that difficult of an assignment to do, I just had to use some google to help me. 
I learned how to wire up and use a photointerrupter with CircuitPython in this assignment. 

	  
	#CircuitPython Distance Censor 

For this assignment I had to make the distance censor measure how far something was away from it, this was easy because we pretty much did this same thing last year. The only thing that was diffrent was that the neopixel light on the board would fade between diffrent colors depending on how far away whatever was in the way of the censor. 
So I learned how to make the neopixel and the distance censor talk to eachother so it knew what color to fade to and at what distance.
